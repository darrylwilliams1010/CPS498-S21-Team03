> #### Intro
   For this project, we were tasked with improving the training modules for the Simbionix LAP Mentor. The existing modules on the LAP Mentor were good for training with their specific system, but because all of the modules used the same model of a human to operate in, there was no diversity in the operating areas. All of the body parts were in the same place and were all the same size, and medical residents practicing with the LAP Mentor regularly could easily get used to where everything was and be unprepared for real patients who would come in all shapes and sizes. 
   
   Due to some difficulties along the way with acquiring the existing modules howerver, we readjusted our goals to instead create our own version of some of the LAP Mentor modules in VR, where they could be more accessible to the public than Simbionix's system. Our team created four modules that could be used to improve on beginner skills like locating an object, removing an object, or precise movement of the camera. Our modules were created in Unity using the Oculus VR integration Package to allow better controller movement. We each worked to create our own custom modules, so each level has its own look and feel to it.
   
   \* At this time, keyboard input is used as an alternative since there are unknown errors with picking up objects in our modules.  Our system consists of four different projects, so instead of uploading them here on GitHub, we uploaded them into a Ondrive folder which can be accessed with permission from a member of our team.
