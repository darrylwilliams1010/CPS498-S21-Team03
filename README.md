# Laparoscopic Surgical Training System
> ### _CPS498 Senior Design - Spring 2021 - Team 03_

This project will create training modules for surgeons to practice with so that they can be better prepared to use the laparoscopic robot during real surgery.
We will use scripts provided to us to create the module scenes in Unity and ensure that the on-screen visuals match up with the external controllers.
