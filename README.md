# Laparoscopic Surgical Training System
> ### _CPS498 Senior Design - Spring 2021 - Team 03_

This project will create training modules for surgeons to practice with so that they can be better prepared to use the laparoscopic robot during real surgery.
We will use scripts provided to us to create the module scenes in Unity and ensure that the on-screen visuals match up with the external controllers.

 Figure 1 is the model and brand of vr we use for our project. This allowed user to be the fully immersed in the training module. Users can use the headset to look around the modules as if they were in the module themselves. For some of the modules the vr controllers are usable to grab objects.

Figure 2 is the score interface for the modules. Users can see their scores in real time. The score is calculated by how much the user moves the pointer in the module. The higher the score the lower the grade the user will receive.
